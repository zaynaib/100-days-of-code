##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**:
Started 30 site in 30 days challenge. 

D3 is not a charting library 

*mind blown*

D3 is a javascript framework for building web graphics.
 w3school definition Web graphics are visual representations used on a Web site to enhance or enable the representation of an idea or feeling, in order to reach the Web site user.


Design patterns of D3.js
Selecting is a core functionality of D3.js
A **selection** is the group of the data and element together.
Selection as a set of web page elements and a corresponding associated set of data

D3 workflow

1. load web page/ select elements
2. Bind data without modifying the apperance of the webpage
3. create/update elements that change the structure of the page. 


DOM - Document Object Modely
Its basically the strutuce of the webpage.

Three categories of information that determine the behavior of a dom element
Styles - transparency, color, size, borders etc.
Attributes - classs, IDS, and interactive behavior
Properties - States i.e checked - for check box property

SVG - Scalable vector graphics 
SVG shape primatives - circles, rect, line, polygon



**Thoughts** : I get easily distracted. I should just avoid browsing on youtube from now on.
