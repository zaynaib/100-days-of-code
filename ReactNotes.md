React is a declarative language that makes it easier to create dynamic UIs.
We isoloate these UI into small componets. i.e head, article, footer , shopping list etc

All react componets are subclasses of the React.componet class.

React gets information from props to render a view

Render is a description of what we want to see in a view. 
In order to create an element we will use React.createElement('div')
