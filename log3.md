# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 18, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started a new course on Coursera called Algorithmic Toolbox.

**Thoughts** : Say this every time I code but this course is pretty rough. At least I am implementing things that I learned from my Python Mentorship and from a previous course that I took from Coursea called Python For Everyone: Data Structures. I now know how to iterate through python data structures better. I'm not a master but now I'm not a complete novice. I also learned about [stress testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_testing_(software)).

### Day 2: June 19, 2019 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: I corrected my Maximum Product Pairwise algorithm code. I watched a couple of videos of the Algorithmic ToolBox course.

**Thoughts** : I was struggling to see what I did wrong with my solution. Sometimes its just best to ask someone else. Next time I will try to take a break and then go back to the problem.

### Day 3: June 20, 2019 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: I completed watching week 2 videos of algorithms coursera course. I started doing psuedocode for the homework.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty chill. I did not code that much. I should get back to bullet journaling and setting mini goals for myself in order to make progress. So the goals that I have setup for tomorrow is to learn about Python itertools library. The goal for Saturday June 21,2019 is to learn about Python Collection library.

### Day 5: June 22, 2019 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: I didn't do anything today. Just relaxed

**Thoughts**: It was a chill day.



### Day 6: June 23, 2019 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: No progress. Just created a README file for the D3.js study group

**Thoughts**: I need to get use to writing clear documentation online. It's one of the most important part of a project.

### Day 7: June 24, 2019 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Completed week's 2 homework assignment for Coursera Algorithm Toolbox class.

**Thoughts**: This week was not so bad. It was easier than last week since the grader gave me more detail on what test I failed. I will try to refactor things tomorrow.

### Day 8: June 25, 2019 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Started on week 3 homework assignment.

**Thoughts**: Finished the first problem in the homework assignment. I'm feeling better about my problem solving skills. I also found my old portfolio site from the Northwestern bootcamp. I need to revamp a lot of my old work.

### Day 9: June 27, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed maximum loot problem. I want to find a way to make the code a little neater.
**Thoughts**: I'm just glad things got done.

### Day 11: June 28, 2019 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Still pushing through. My maixmum loot code does not pass the grader. But I learned the importance of avoiding working on the master branch on github. Git branches are my friend.

**Thoughts**: It felt like all of my code wasn't working. I tried to do a pull request on an old repo and that blew face :)  Attempted to finish minimum number of stops for gas. I wanted to rage quit. T_T Being so lost made me wonder if I can make it in the industry. T_T I'm going to try to revamp some projects from bootcamp.
