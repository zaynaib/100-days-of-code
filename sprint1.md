### Day 20 October 28, 2019

**Todays Progress**

Today I decided to work on technical interview questions. 
I watched Colt Steele's Algorithm bootcamp and reviewed Big O notation.
Colt is a really good teacher I enjoy learning the theory behind programming.

I also did two coding challenges on the CodeWars website. I do fine on level 8 katas but the upper level katas I am just awful. It really shows me that I am not familiar with the javascript language.

I also watched The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures by Stephen Grider. I went over the basic reverse a word problem and I learned two new javascript functions.

Strategy is to go slow and steady and be consistent.

Learned the difference between *for in* and *for of*
For in is a looping function that is specifically for  javascript objects.
For of is a looping function that is specifically for javascript iterables such as array, map or set.

**Thoughts**
I need to get more comfortable with javascript. I can make solutions to algorithms but
I can't solve them without knowing javascript language well enough.

### Day 19 October 27, 2019
I just relaxed on Sunday and create a lesson plan for the week to come.


### Day 18 October 26, 2019

**What I did Today**

Completed most of the recommended changes.

### Day 17 October 25, 2019

**What I did Today**

Turned in my chingu cohort Pre Work Today!
Someone reviewed it and send a list of recommended changes.
`
There is 2 mandatory changes and some recommendation which I think you should still follow.

First the mandatory stuff:
1. https://i.imgur.com/zuCOFcx.png
When somebody deletes all the text in the type something box, it just displays empty boxes instead of the earlier preset text.

2. Please include a link to your live website version in the readme file. The readme is an essential tool for anyone looking at your project :)

Recommendations:
1. https://i.imgur.com/FcyW80T.png
It would be nice to delete all the logs from the console when you are shipping a production website.

2. Including a favicon. Its nice to have one, it also throws an error message sometimes if you don't

3. https://i.imgur.com/r7XnZCf.png
there is a missing space after 2019^^

4. https://i.imgur.com/o76xk6R.png
It would be nicer to use an p element instead of an input box for the fonts. Or you could also disable it in css so that the user can not write in the font cards

5. The reset button should also reset the type anything box (input)
`

### Day 16 October 24, 2019
To dos
- get a handle on event delegations
- learn the difference between onclick and and addeventlistner
- learn about async and await

### Day 15 October 23, 2019

Learn how to think of git branches when to create them and when to delete them.
`git branch -d {branch name}`

Learn how to merge branches in the command line
` git branch merge {branch name}`
Learn the difference between node vs element in javascript today.

Learn that difference between foreach and map:

The foreach function loops over an array and execute a function to the elements in the array. The forEach function modifies the orignal array. 

The map function also loops through an array and execute function to the elements but it does *not* modify the orignal array. It creates a new array with modify elements while keeping the orignal array untouched.

I also learned that The getElementsByClassName() method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name, as a NodeList object. 

I learned about the CSS Grid Layout today! It is similar to Flexbox but it makes create gutters easier.

I relearned relative and absoulte postioning.

I learned grid and flexbox ** *gotchas* **. Flexbox and Grid layout only works for elements in the DOM that are parent and child. Flexbox does not apply to an elements grandchild, great grandchild etc.

### Day 14 October 22, 2019

**Goals for today**

- Reset css,to see if it makes it easier to style
- Read more about media queries
- test the list and grid layout of what I already have
 Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)

 **What did I do Today**

 Nothing much to report. I used a datalist to create 4 defaut size options to font size form input.

 I am still confused about one of the requirements for the chingu tier 1 challenge.

### Day 13 October 21, 2019 - Monday

**What did I do Today**
- Set up basic logic for the Google Font Clone project.

 When user adds in text it displays on the web page.
The user can change the size of the text using input buttons it will automatically change.

- Set up the basic html structure of the site
- Still working on the CSS. Its the hardest part of this project. CSS is not my strong suit but I enjoy a good challenge.
- I googled a lot of resources to help me with this project. I will be sure to read them.


**Nuggets of Wisdom**

When to delete a git branch? - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5330145/when-to-delete-branches-in-git)

It often helps to think of branches as ideas. A fairly good rule of thumb is that if you're done working on the ideas that the branch represents - including done testing and incorporating those changes (merging them into master) - you're done with the branch itself. 

How to delete git branches from command line.
`git branch -d yourbranch`

### Day 12 August 25, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Clean up Github Profile
- Add README files to projects

### Day 11 August 24, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Create basic html page for bank account app to get user input
- Link JQuery to application
- Watch Derek Bananas UML video


### Day 10: August 23,  2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- ~~Practice D3 workflow create a bar chart with animation~~
- ~~Learn how to create tool tips in D3~~
- ~~Read more about modularization in D3~~
- ~~Make jasmine work in html~~
- Make app interact with index.html


**Progress**: I struggled a lot today.

 *What went well*

 I created a setup function for each of my test in the BankAccountSpec. It least my code looks better than what it did during bootcamp.

*What went wrong*

 I realized there was no point in using the jasmine framework as a stand alone html app. If it works in node.js then its fine. I tried to make my bank account app into a full stack app but I got confused on how to use npm module export modules with my index.html page. I have to plan out the View for my app with paper and pen later on.
 I need to go over the fundamentals of javascript. I had a scoping issue with my setup spec and I would not have been able to figure it out without stackoverflow. I know I'm not going to be an expert in everything. But I would like to be a good problem hunter.

### Day 10: October 18, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

**Progress**:

**What I Learned**:
Variables are scoped to functions. If you define it inside the function, it will be cleared/reset every time the function exits (i.e., after every click event).

Basically, variables are local not only to functions, but to individual function calls.



### Day 9: August 22,  2019 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Practice D3 workflow create a bar chart with animation
- Learn how to create tool tips in D3
- Read more about modularization in D3
- Make jasmine work in html
- Make app interact with index.html


**Progress**: I made no progress today. I just relaxed and chilled with my family today.

### Day 8: August 21,  2019 - Wedensday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Bank Account Program


**Progress**: I finally finished the logic for this Bank Account Program. Today I learned how to override methods in subclasses. I still did not figure out ho to
test error messages. I might go ask someone for help with that. I also notice that I easily get distracted while working. So I am going to hone my skill to focus by using the pomodro technique. 

### Day 7: August 20,  2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Program

**Progress**:  I am 90 % done with unit test for bank account program. Today I learned how to create/override a constructor in a subclass by using the super keyword. I wanted to create a error messages when someone over withdrawls from their account. But I had trouble testing my error messages with the Jasmine testing framework. I also found a bug in my code while I was creating test for a savings account subclass. I am glad that I decided to now work in a project based learning. It is helping me identify my weak points in my knowledge. I need to write more blog post to get in the habit of explaining myself. i.e. job interviews. The TDD concept is new too me but with practice I will get better.

What is a Class?
A blueprint to create an object.

What is a Constructor?
A routine that creates an object from a class.

### Day 6: July 30,  2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Program
- Learn about inheritance Pluarlsight video 3
- Create a bar chart with simple data/ axes
- Learn two multi-cursor short cuts from VS Code

**Progress**: I did not make progress today. I had a long day and did not code at all today.
I went to the People of Color Code Meetup at where [@Bryon](https://www.byronwoodfork.com/page/about/) spoke about Test Driven Development

Learned about why should I practice TDD

- Recieve quick feedback
- Red --> Green --> Refactor
- Provides documentation on what our code does
- Encourage incremental steps when building code

### Day 5: July 29,  2019 - Monday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:
No code today

**Progress**: I did not make progress today. I had a long day and did not code at all today.
I went to the People of Color Code Meetup at where [@Bryon](https://www.byronwoodfork.com/page/about/) spoke about Test Driven Development

Learned about why should I practice TDD

- Recieve quick feedback
- Red --> Green --> Refactor
- Provides documentation on what our code does
- Encourage incremental steps when building code


### Day 4: July 28,  2019 - Sunday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Learn about class inheritance 
- Learn how to create javascript test using Level up tuts for Bank Account Object Oriented Program


**Progress**: 

**OOP**: Did not really make progress learning about Object Oriented Programming. I had some trouble creating test for my Bank Account Program. I used  node.js to install a package for the Jasmine Javascript testing framework. I had trouble with fundamental node concepts like export and require. 

Tutorials that I used to understand Node.js Exports:
[Stack Abuse - How to use module.exports](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-use-module-exports-in-node-js/)
[Tutorials Teacher Export Module in Node.js](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/nodejs-module-exports)

<!-- ! insert screen shot of test being passed  -->


### Day 3: July 27,  2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Learn about ToolTips in D3.js
- Learn about class inheritance 
- Learn how to create javascript test using Level up tuts for Bank Account Object Oriented Program


**Progress**:

**D3**
Created tooltips for scatter plot. Whenever the mouse hovers over any of the circles a pop up appears and  says *Hello World*. In order to accomplish this I had to learn about mouse events [pageX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageX) and [pageY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageY) which will give you the x and y coordinates of the mouse on the page. To learn more about d3 events I checked out the d3 tutor website: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/event-handling-in-d3js.

<!-- ! @TO Put screen shots of D3 Projects Here -->

This took me the whole day to figure out. My x and y axis are still messed up. :( .

**VS**
Finally learned about a shortcut for creating comments in visual studio chrome. `Ctrl + K` and `Ctrl + C`

**OOP**
Made no progress with my Bank Account project.

**Thoughts**
Feel good about myself. I am learning more by doing a project based approach then to passively learn and go through tutorials. D3 kicked my but today. I think I just need to focus on the basic workflow of D3 instead of learn about the interactive parts for D3 at the moment. My goal is to my a comptent beginner for [vizFest unconf](http://visfest.com/unconf2019/)

### Day 2: July 26, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Fix left  and right axis positions
- Create a label for both axis
- Finish lesson 3 in Pluralsight Course
- Read more about D3 joins and update pattern
- VS Code Extentsions  Live Server, prettier comments
- Read about [Debugging JS with Chrome](https://scotch.io/tutorials/debugging-javascript-in-google-chrome-and-visual-studio-code)


**Progress**:

**OOP**

Finished Lesson 3 of OOP course on Pluralsight. Gave me some flashbacks of my high school computer science course where we learned Java. 

Read a FreeCodeCamp article about the guranteed way to get a programming job is do project. So it just motivated me to create a mini oop project on banking account.

Learned about Getters and Setters in Javascript https://javascriptplayground.com/es5-getters-setters/
Working on bank app.


**VS**
Learned that VSCode Live Server is pretty simple plugin to use. All I have to do is click on the *Go Live* button on the bottom right hand side of my text editor and bam. My local host server is up. As far as I know this can be only used for front end applications and not backend applications.


Watch [Better Comments Plugin Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wft93GaVMfc) //// It seems like it can only be used for javascript files.

**D3**

Did not make much progress with D3.js today. I reviewed some old notes and videos about adding axis and margins but I could not figure out how to correct the position of them.

**Links To Work**:
[Bank Account Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/zaynaib/CS_Concepts)

**Thoughts**:
I am glad that I'm doing a project based approach. I feel like I understand the material deeper and got more accomplished by practicing what I learn. I get to catch what gaps in my knowledge quicker too.



### Day 1: July 25, 2019 - Thursday
**Today's Project(s)**:

- Learn Visual Code shortcuts
- Practice Data Prep with D3.js
- Post Progress on Twitter
- Work on Object Oriented Programing (OOP) Pluralsight course by Mark Zamoyta

**Progress**: 

*D3*: I updated a scatterplot that I made with D3 version 4 to D3 version 5. I also refactored my code so can more modular. I need to clean up the axis by positioning them correctly and labeling them. 

*OOP*: Also went through Mark Zamoyta's course today it's review so far.

 VS: 
 Learned how to create mulitple cursors using Visual studio code `Shift + ctrl + alt + arrow keys`

 To open the terminal Ctrl + `

 Workspaces are useful for projects large that have complicated folder structures. It's not useful to have a workspace for a simple on folder project. Check out [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44629890/what-is-a-workspace-in-vs-code)

 Found an article about dope [Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/22-best-visual-studio-code-extensions-for-web-development#toc-16-better-comments)

[Cheat Sheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) for all shortcuts

**Links to Work**:
[Version 4](https://github.com/zaynaib/dataVizPractice/blob/practice/D3-Homework/assets/public/js/app.js)
[Version 5](https://github.com/zaynaib/dataVizPractice/blob/master/D3-Homework/assets/public/js/app.js)

**Thoughts**: Things are going slowly but surely. D3 is a huge library and I feel like its going to take me a year to figure out what's going on. I'm glad that Mike Bostock has created good docs of his library. I can't wait to revamp some of my bootcamp project to OOP and react.
