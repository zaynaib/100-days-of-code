- Set up basic logic for the project.
- when user adds in text it displays on the web page.
- when user decides to change the size of the text it will automatically change as well
- Set up the basic html structure of the site
- Still working on the CSS. Its the hardest part of this project. CSS is not my strong suit but I enjoy a good challenge.
- I googled a lot of resources to help me with this project. I will be sure to read them.


**Nuggets of Wisdom**

When to delete a git branch? - StackOverflow

It often helps to think of branches as ideas. A fairly good rule of thumb is that if you're done working on the ideas that the branch represents - including done testing and incorporating those changes (merging them into master) - you're done with the branch itself. 

How to delete git branches from command line.
`git branch -d yourbranch`

### Day 12 August 25, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Clean up Github Profile
- Add README files to projects

### Day 11 August 24, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Create basic html page for bank account app to get user input
- Link JQuery to application
- Watch Derek Bananas UML video


### Day 10: August 23,  2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- ~~Practice D3 workflow create a bar chart with animation~~
- ~~Learn how to create tool tips in D3~~
- ~~Read more about modularization in D3~~
- ~~Make jasmine work in html~~
- Make app interact with index.html


**Progress**: I struggled a lot today.

 *What went well*

 I created a setup function for each of my test in the BankAccountSpec. It least my code looks better than what it did during bootcamp.

*What went wrong*

 I realized there was no point in using the jasmine framework as a stand alone html app. If it works in node.js then its fine. I tried to make my bank account app into a full stack app but I got confused on how to use npm module export modules with my index.html page. I have to plan out the View for my app with paper and pen later on.
 I need to go over the fundamentals of javascript. I had a scoping issue with my setup spec and I would not have been able to figure it out without stackoverflow. I know I'm not going to be an expert in everything. But I would like to be a good problem hunter.

### Day 10: October 18, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

**Progress**:

**What I Learned**:
Variables are scoped to functions. If you define it inside the function, it will be cleared/reset every time the function exits (i.e., after every click event).

Basically, variables are local not only to functions, but to individual function calls.



### Day 9: August 22,  2019 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Practice D3 workflow create a bar chart with animation
- Learn how to create tool tips in D3
- Read more about modularization in D3
- Make jasmine work in html
- Make app interact with index.html


**Progress**: I made no progress today. I just relaxed and chilled with my family today.

### Day 8: August 21,  2019 - Wedensday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Bank Account Program


**Progress**: I finally finished the logic for this Bank Account Program. Today I learned how to override methods in subclasses. I still did not figure out ho to
test error messages. I might go ask someone for help with that. I also notice that I easily get distracted while working. So I am going to hone my skill to focus by using the pomodro technique. 

### Day 7: August 20,  2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Program

**Progress**:  I am 90 % done with unit test for bank account program. Today I learned how to create/override a constructor in a subclass by using the super keyword. I wanted to create a error messages when someone over withdrawls from their account. But I had trouble testing my error messages with the Jasmine testing framework. I also found a bug in my code while I was creating test for a savings account subclass. I am glad that I decided to now work in a project based learning. It is helping me identify my weak points in my knowledge. I need to write more blog post to get in the habit of explaining myself. i.e. job interviews. The TDD concept is new too me but with practice I will get better.

What is a Class?
A blueprint to create an object.

What is a Constructor?
A routine that creates an object from a class.

### Day 6: July 30,  2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Finish javascript test for OOP Program
- Learn about inheritance Pluarlsight video 3
- Create a bar chart with simple data/ axes
- Learn two multi-cursor short cuts from VS Code

**Progress**: I did not make progress today. I had a long day and did not code at all today.
I went to the People of Color Code Meetup at where [@Bryon](https://www.byronwoodfork.com/page/about/) spoke about Test Driven Development

Learned about why should I practice TDD

- Recieve quick feedback
- Red --> Green --> Refactor
- Provides documentation on what our code does
- Encourage incremental steps when building code

### Day 5: July 29,  2019 - Monday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:
No code today

**Progress**: I did not make progress today. I had a long day and did not code at all today.
I went to the People of Color Code Meetup at where [@Bryon](https://www.byronwoodfork.com/page/about/) spoke about Test Driven Development

- Recieve quick feedback
- Red --> Green --> Refactor
- Provides documentation on what our code does
- Encourage incremental steps when building code


### Day 4: July 28,  2019 - Sunday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Learn about class inheritance 
- Learn how to create javascript test using Level up tuts for Bank Account Object Oriented Program


**Progress**: 

**OOP**: Did not really make progress learning about Object Oriented Programming. I had some trouble creating test for my Bank Account Program. I used  node.js to install a package for the Jasmine Javascript testing framework. I had trouble with fundamental node concepts like export and require. 

Tutorials that I used to understand Node.js Exports:
[Stack Abuse - How to use module.exports](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-use-module-exports-in-node-js/)
[Tutorials Teacher Export Module in Node.js](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/nodejs-module-exports)

<!-- ! insert screen shot of test being passed  -->


### Day 3: July 27,  2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Learn about ToolTips in D3.js
- Learn about class inheritance 
- Learn how to create javascript test using Level up tuts for Bank Account Object Oriented Program


**Progress**:

**D3**
Created tooltips for scatter plot. Whenever the mouse hovers over any of the circles a pop up appears and  says *Hello World*. In order to accomplish this I had to learn about mouse events [pageX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageX) and [pageY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageY) which will give you the x and y coordinates of the mouse on the page. To learn more about d3 events I checked out the d3 tutor website: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/event-handling-in-d3js.

<!-- ! @TO Put screen shots of D3 Projects Here -->

This took me the whole day to figure out. My x and y axis are still messed up. :( .

**VS**
Finally learned about a shortcut for creating comments in visual studio chrome. `Ctrl + K` and `Ctrl + C`

**OOP**
Made no progress with my Bank Account project.

**Thoughts**
Feel good about myself. I am learning more by doing a project based approach then to passively learn and go through tutorials. D3 kicked my but today. I think I just need to focus on the basic workflow of D3 instead of learn about the interactive parts for D3 at the moment. My goal is to my a comptent beginner for [vizFest unconf](http://visfest.com/unconf2019/)

### Day 2: July 26, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Project(s) Goals**:

- Fix left  and right axis positions
- Create a label for both axis
- Finish lesson 3 in Pluralsight Course
- Read more about D3 joins and update pattern
- VS Code Extentsions  Live Server, prettier comments
- Read about [Debugging JS with Chrome](https://scotch.io/tutorials/debugging-javascript-in-google-chrome-and-visual-studio-code)


**Progress**:

**OOP**

Finished Lesson 3 of OOP course on Pluralsight. Gave me some flashbacks of my high school computer science course where we learned Java. 

Read a FreeCodeCamp article about the guranteed way to get a programming job is do project. So it just motivated me to create a mini oop project on banking account.

Learned about Getters and Setters in Javascript https://javascriptplayground.com/es5-getters-setters/
Working on bank app.


**VS**
Learned that VSCode Live Server is pretty simple plugin to use. All I have to do is click on the *Go Live* button on the bottom right hand side of my text editor and bam. My local host server is up. As far as I know this can be only used for front end applications and not backend applications.


Watch [Better Comments Plugin Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wft93GaVMfc) //// It seems like it can only be used for javascript files.

**D3**

Did not make much progress with D3.js today. I reviewed some old notes and videos about adding axis and margins but I could not figure out how to correct the position of them.

**Links To Work**:
[Bank Account Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/zaynaib/CS_Concepts)

**Thoughts**:
I am glad that I'm doing a project based approach. I feel like I understand the material deeper and got more accomplished by practicing what I learn. I get to catch what gaps in my knowledge quicker too.



### Day 1: July 25, 2019 - Thursday
**Today's Project(s)**:

- Learn Visual Code shortcuts
- Practice Data Prep with D3.js
- Post Progress on Twitter
- Work on Object Oriented Programing (OOP) Pluralsight course by Mark Zamoyta

**Progress**: 

*D3*: I updated a scatterplot that I made with D3 version 4 to D3 version 5. I also refactored my code so can more modular. I need to clean up the axis by positioning them correctly and labeling them. 

*OOP*: Also went through Mark Zamoyta's course today it's review so far.

 VS: 
 Learned how to create mulitple cursors using Visual studio code `Shift + ctrl + alt + arrow keys`

 To open the terminal Ctrl + `

 Workspaces are useful for projects large that have complicated folder structures. It's not useful to have a workspace for a simple on folder project. Check out [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44629890/what-is-a-workspace-in-vs-code)

 Found an article about dope [Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/22-best-visual-studio-code-extensions-for-web-development#toc-16-better-comments)

[Cheat Sheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) for all shortcuts

**Links to Work**:
[Version 4](https://github.com/zaynaib/dataVizPractice/blob/practice/D3-Homework/assets/public/js/app.js)
[Version 5](https://github.com/zaynaib/dataVizPractice/blob/master/D3-Homework/assets/public/js/app.js)

**Thoughts**: Things are going slowly but surely. D3 is a huge library and I feel like its going to take me a year to figure out what's going on. I'm glad that Mike Bostock has created good docs of his library. I can't wait to revamp some of my bootcamp project to OOP and react.
