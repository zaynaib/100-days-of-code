**Progress**: 

*D3*: I updated a scatterplot that I made with D3 version 4 to D3 version 5. I also refactored my code so can more modular. I need to clean up the axis by positioning them correctly and labeling them. 

*OOP*: Also went through Mark Zamoyta's course today it's review so far.

 VS: 
 Learned how to create mulitple cursors using Visual studio code `Shift + ctrl + alt + arrow keys`

 To open the terminal Ctrl + `

 Workspaces are useful for projects large that have complicated folder structures. It's not useful to have a workspace for a simple on folder project. Check out [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44629890/what-is-a-workspace-in-vs-code)

 Found an article about dope [Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/22-best-visual-studio-code-extensions-for-web-development#toc-16-better-comments)

**Thoughts**: Things are going slowly but surely. D3 is a huge library and I feel like its going to take me a year to figure out what's going on. I'm glad that Mike Bostock has created good docs of his library. I can't wait to revamp some of my bootcamp project to OOP and react.
