# 100 Days of Code

This is part of Alexander Kallaway's [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) challenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: [https://www.100daysofcode.com/](100daysofcode.com).

I am also inspired by James Priest's [100DaysOfCode log](https://github.com/james-priest/100-days-of-code-log).
The goal for the next 100 Days Code is not only to keep myself accountable but to also be more intentional on what I am learning. 
In order to succeed it not only important to have goals but to break those goals up into clear definable tasks in order to move foward. 

Commitment: I will code daily for the next 100 days. I will be breaking the 100 days into 30 Day Sprints.


Have no major barriers to entry (nothing preventing you from starting). For example, to learn knife skills, you don’t have to purchase an entire expensive set of chef’s knives. You just need a basic kitchen utility knife that you may already own or can buy with minimal investment.
Consist of very clearly defined, actionable Tasks. Your knife skills might be broken down into holding a knife properly, sharpening, peeling, slicing, dicing, cubing, mincing, and so on.
Have a fixed, relatively short time frame for completion (should take less than a month to complete, ideally a week or two). Just making a salad several days a week and mastering a simple vegetable soup recipe would get your knife skills up to speed pretty quickly.
