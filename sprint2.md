# Sprint #1

## Goals for Month January 

- [] Work on a project at least 1 hr a day.
- [] Learn Object Oriented Program with Python
- [] Be more proficent in VS Code Editor



## December 31, 2019

## Today's Progress:

APIE - Abstraction, polymorphism, Inheritance, encapsulation 

- Object Oriented Analysis(OOA) - Understand your problem
- Object Oriented Design(OOD) - Create/ Design your solution to the problem
- Object Oriented Programming(OOP) - Program your solution

Whenever I am doing an OOA that object in my user stories are nouns (people,place,thing,concept).
When designing a program I can use `the` test to determine if a concept is an object. It's similar to `has-a` relationship test or `is-a` relationship test.

Aggregation and Composition are similar. In both you are combining different objects to create a whole new object. They both use the `has-a` relationship test. 
But Composition is a relationship of ownership. An object has ownership over another object. Some people use `part-of` relationship or `owns-of` relationship.  While aggreation objects can be independent of each other.
[Programming Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOo_BosuJBE) has a great youtube series breaking down OOP in Python.

Learned that in Python you cannot [overload](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6434482/python-function-overloading) methods.


## Thoughts: 
Did not make much progress today. I am somewhat burnt out. Going to take a break for the new year.

## Today's Progress:

- Learned how to do string interpolation with python 3 using [fstring](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/). 
Its similar to Javascript interporation witn the tick marks.

- Learned how to make [default arguments](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/default-arguments-in-python/) in a Python class

- Learned that unit test should be [self documenting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1726622/how-should-unit-tests-be-documented) meaning that the name of the unit test should be descriptive

- Learned about OOP Concept called Composition,defining a new class based on existing classes. Usually signified with `HAS-A relationship` .  i.e. A car has an engine.

While inheritance you are using the same blueprint of an exisitng class but you are making simple modifications. Inheritance is signifined with a `IS-A realtionship` i.e. A sword is a weapon.

## Thoughts:
Just hoping that I can last at least 7 days on this 100 day challenge. -_-
