##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 01, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started edx.org course on asynchronous programming with javascript. Reviewed time functions in javascript. Also, customized Visual Code Studio to link up with git bash for windows as my default terminal.
yay!!!

**Thoughts** : Slow motion is better than no motion. I feel like studying and 
playing around with javascript will only improve my understand of it.
I want to make coding a habit.

### Day 3: January 03, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still reverse engineering the memory game from edx Asncyhouous Javascript course. I got the table to be displayed.
                      And now I am working on the toggle show/hide buttons from jquery. Tomorrow I will use the keyword this in order to hide one element instead of classes and ids.

**Thoughts** :Today I took my own adviced and used the pomodoro clock method to stay somewhat focused today. I have to work on waking up early.
              Need to start bullet journaling again. It kept me focused and productive last year.
