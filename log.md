# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 01, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started edx.org course on asynchronous programming with javascript. Reviewed time functions in javascript. Also, customized Visual Code Studio to link up with git bash for windows as my default terminal.
yay!!!

**Thoughts** : Slow motion is better than no motion. I feel like studying and 
playing around with javascript will only improve my understand of it.
I want to make coding a habit.

### Day 2: January 02, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried reverse engineering a memory game that is on edx. Just worked on the psuedo code.

**Thoughts** :I barley got any work done. I think I'm going to try to start waking up earlier and using the pomodoro clock method.

### Day 3: January 03, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still reverse engineering the memory game from edx Asncyhouous Javascript course. I got the table to be displayed.
                      And now I am working on the toggle show/hide buttons from jquery. Tomorrow I will use the keyword this in order to hide one element instead of classes and ids.

**Thoughts** :Today I took my own adviced and used the pomodoro clock method to stay somewhat focused today. I have to work on waking up early.
              Need to start bullet journaling again. It kept me focused and productive last year.

### Day 4: January 04, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still reverse engineering the memory game from edx Asncyhouous Javascript course. Worked on the css of the table and used                          the this key word in order to hide indiviual cells. I also forgot that append in not a javscript function but a JQuery                             function that allows you to add something to the DOM not an array.
**Thoughts** :Today I coded with some of my friends in the Cool Coding Cats meetup. I need to work on the little nuances of javascript. I learned                the concept of bubbling. I just feel kind of behind on learning javascript. I need to manage my time properly.

### Day 5: January 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Still reverse engineering the memory game from edx Asncyhouous Javascript course. Discovered the psuedo class hover is not                         only for anchor links but for all elements in html!

**Thoughts** :Today I took my own adviced and used the pomodoro clock method to stay somewhat focused today. I have to work on waking up early.
              Need to start bullet journaling again. It kept me focused and productive last year.

### Day 6: April 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Looked at Udacity Google Scholarship material. Look over d3.js code version 4 tutorial from a site called tutorialpoint.com.
Created a hello world selection of a d3 element.

**Thoughts** :I am tired as hell. But I said that I will start the 100 days of code journey and that's what I'm going to do.

### Day 7: April 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Looked at the tutorialpoint tutorial about d3.js. Learned about the text method. There are to ways to use it.
.text() -> is to recieve text from a DOM element
.text("Hello World!") -> is to insert text into the DOM
Did not realize this before.
**Thoughts** :I'm still tired. I have to find a better way to sneak in some more coding lessons. Maybe study while I'm on the train. I also have to cut out meetups. Find a balance between work and play.

### Day 8: April 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed the animal card challenge from the Google Udacity Nanodegree. Thank goodness for the slack channel. I still have to work on css layout and better understand the box model. 
**Thoughts** : Still very sleepy. But I think I'm getting the hang of coding daily on the side.

### Day 9: October 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Decided to do a 30 day challenge on Pure CSS images. I'm really bad a CSS and I'm
hoping that creating cute images will get me motivated to master CSS.
**Thoughts** : I just followed the tutorial from Mike Mangialardi on CSS Images. I bushed up on different
css positioning. The most important part of the article is a formula to set the images dead center in a div.
`(100 - widthOftheDiv) / 2`
